### New Screens

If you need a new Screen, create a new screen in screens directory.

Every Screen must have a `screen.tsx` file, a `screen.presets.ts` file and a `variant/screenVariant.tsx` like `HomeScreen.tsx` and her variants are `HomeScreenDesktop.tsx`, `HomeScreenTablet.tsx`, ...

REMENBER: CREATE A SCREEN VARIANT ONLY if it necessary. Else use the same screen with flex structure.
REMEBER: If u need a new Screen, first determine the new most ATOMIC component nonexistent, to maximise the reuse of a component.

###Â Posible Screen structure

- loginscreen
- signupscreen
